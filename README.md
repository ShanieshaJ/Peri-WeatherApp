<h2>Overview:</h2>
</section>

<p> This project is made from the bootcamp course called SheCodes Plus. This course has **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript** but with more information to learn. I learnt from this course is that you have to create a design (Wireframe/Framework) for a weather application using InVision software. Then used CodeSandBox to code mini JavaScript execises to understand. The first 4 weeks we would slowly build the weather application. </p>

<p> The last 4 weeks is where I discovered that I have been just using **GitHub** and not **Git** (The holy grail version control for all developers). I  also learned how to use Git from taking a <strong style = "color:yellow;">Free</strong> course from Udemy called <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/git-essentials-mini-course/">Git Essentials: Mini Course</a>. At first I was very overwhelmed with the amount of commands that I had to remember when working with projects but it gets better with time and practice.

The most important commands to remember are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
git branch
git merge
git checkout
git push
git pull
```

Then is Introduction to API (Application Programming Interface) and what it does:
